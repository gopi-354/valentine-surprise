            <p>Dear Harshini,</p>
            <p>
                I never thought in my wildest dreams, that I can be this happy in my life. You say that we didn’t get to
                spend quality time when we were together after marriage. But, I was just sitting there and soaking it
                all in. Simply put, I was just enjoying your presence. I get that its no excuse to not actively having a
                conversation, but I thought I should say this to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                When our marriage planning started, I was panicking. Things were moving so fast. But, you were there for
                me making sure that I enjoy the process and not be overwhelmed. Whenever I start talking about my
                ridiculous dreams and stuff I wanna do, you were there listening to it and not saying that my dream is
                unrealistic. What more can a dreamer ask for.
            </p>
            <p>
                I strongly believe that my life’s purpose is to take good care of my family and the way to do it is by
                working hard. But, you made me understand that spending time with them is even more important than
                running after something to make their life better. I am excited to share this journey with you by my
                side. Thank you for being my wife, for making me understand the value of staying in the present and for
                loving me so much. What more can a guy ask for.
            </p>
