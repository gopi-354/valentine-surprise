            <p>Dear Harshini,</p>
            <p>
                I never thought, even in my <strong>wildest dreams</strong>, that I could be this happy. You worry that
                we didn't have enough time just us two, but honestly? I was just <strong>enchanted</strong> to be near
                you. It was <strong>golden</strong>, like <strong>daylight</strong>, just soaking it all in.
            </p>
            <p>
                When everything was moving fast, I felt like I was in a <strong>state of grace</strong> because you were
                there, keeping me calm when I wanted to panic. You never looked at my dreams and called them huge or
                unrealistic; instead, you made me feel like <strong>we could be the kings and queens</strong> of
                anything we wanted.
            </p>
            <p>
                I used to think my purpose was just to work hard, <strong>long story short</strong>. But you showed me
                that <strong>it's nice to have a friend</strong>, a partner, a <strong>lover</strong> to actually live
                life with. You taught me that the best things <em>aren't</em> things.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm so excited to be on this journey with you. <strong>Long live</strong> all the magic we made and are
                going to make. Thank you for being the <strong>best thing that's ever been mine</strong>.
            </p>
            <p class="signature">Love,<br>Gopi</p>
